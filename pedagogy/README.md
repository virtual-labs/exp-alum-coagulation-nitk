#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing
the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--
1.| See the displayed objectives and apparatus used then click on next button | Display objective and apparatus used | Recall the experiment
2.|  Click on the lid of bottle containing water sample to open it and take 500ml of it, click on the lid to close the container containing water sample and click on OK to repeat the same for other samples, click on next button | Display take 500ml of water sample in six beakers | To provide basic environment to start the experiment
3.| Click on the lid of alum solution bottle to open the lid then click on the upper arrow of the pipette to take the liquid into the pipette and then click on the bottle to close the lid, click on lower arrow of the pipette to add different dosage of alum solution to the beaker, click on next button | Display add different dosage of alum solution to six beakers with one as blank | To add different dosage of alum solution
4.| Click on the beaker and place it in position, click on OK to place all the other beakers in position, click on the stirrer to lower it, click on OK to repeat it for the all the other stirrers, click on ON button and click on stirrer to set the speed then click on set and repeat the same for next speed, switch it off then click on stirrer to place it back and click on beaker to remove it., click on OK to repeat the same for rest, click on next button to proceed | Display stir the mixture thoroughly at 100 rpm for one minute and at 30rpm for twenty-nine minutes | To thoroughly mix the solution for a defined rpm in order to obtain the uniform mix
